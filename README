This code solves the radiative transfer equation using variable
Eddington factors. The methods are described in the article:

Auer, L. H. "Difference equations and linearization methods for
radiative transfer." Ed. Wolfgang Kalkofen. "Methods in Radiative
Transfer".  Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1984. 237-79.

I use the CMake build system, mostly because I hate writing
makefiles. Here is how to compile the code:

cd vef
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

To run the code, just type

./vef
